# maven-growl-plugin #

A maven execution listener that sends growl notifications during build.

Notification quantity and quality is configurable, of course **not**.

The base class should extend [AbstractExecutionListener](http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.0.4/apidocs/org/apache/maven/execution/AbstractExecutionListener.html). Sample usage code can be found on [GrepCode](http://grepcode.com/search/usages?id=repo1.maven.org$maven2@org.apache.maven$maven-core@3.0.4@org$apache$maven$execution@AbstractExecutionListener&type=type&k=u)
